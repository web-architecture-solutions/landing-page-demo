        Most market data is either too stale or too noisy to be actionable. We
        contextualize the facts when the data at-hand suggests something{" "}
        <em>unusual</em> is happening <em>today</em>. This is where potential
        signals of shifting sentiment, unexpected positioning, and evolving
        volatility expectations can be seen saliently as they unfold.
